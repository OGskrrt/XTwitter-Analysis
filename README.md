Its not full version, major changes coming soon.

Its a console software that retrives fake twitter data from prebuilded json file and finds relationship between users.  The first process is getting username, follower users, following users, all tweets and users interest for every user. 
The user's interest information is determined based on the frequency of word usage in tweets.
As second process, It creates trees according to the received user following-follower information and user interest information. With that, the relationships between users are determined by the trees. 

After the program processing is completed, the relationships between users are found on the console by using tree navigation algorithms as showed below.
